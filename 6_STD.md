This Software Test Documentation (STD) provides the specific test cases required to validate AI-generated VST3 plugins. In 2025, the standard for plugin testing relies heavily on automated "Level 1-10" verification and AI-specific edge case analysis. 1. Automated System Tests (The "Validator" Suite) These tests are executed automatically by the Forge after every build to ensure technical compliance with the VST3 standard. Test ID RequirementTest StepExpected ResultTC-101Technical ComplianceRun vst3validator on the binary.Exit code 0; all VST3 interface checks passed.TC-102Multi-ArchitectureScan plugin on both x64 and ARM64.Successful load on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M-series).TC-103Processing SafetyProcess 5 minutes of white noise at +12dB.No NaN (Not a Number) or Infinity values; output capped at 0dB.TC-104Latency ReportingChange plugin state/parameters.Host correctly receives updated latency values (if any).2. AI Code Integrity Tests (The "Quality" Suite) Since AI can generate syntactically correct but functionally flawed code, these tests verify the internal logic of the generated C++. Test ID RequirementTest StepExpected ResultTC-201UI-to-Processor SyncMove a slider rapidly from 0.0 to 1.0.Audio reflects parameter change without "zipper" noise or pops.TC-202State PersistenceSave a DAW project; close and reopen.Plugin restores all AI-generated parameters to their exact saved values.TC-203Memory Leak CheckInstantiate and delete the plugin 100 times.System memory usage returns to baseline after each deletion.3. Stress & Environment Tests (The "Robustness" Suite) These tests use pluginval (set to strictness level 5+) to push the plugin beyond normal operating conditions. Test ID RequirementTest StepExpected ResultTC-301Variable Buffer SizeChange DAW buffer size (32, 128, 512, 1024).Audio remains glitch-free and stable across all sizes.TC-302Rapid Sampling RateSwitch project sample rate from 44.1kHz to 96kHz.AI DSP math scales correctly; no pitch-shifting or audio artifacts.TC-303MultithreadingModulate 10 parameters via DAW automation simultaneously.Plugin processes audio smoothly with 0% CPU spikes or thread hangs.4. Manual Acceptance Tests (The "Workflow" Suite) Verified by the QA team in late 2025 to ensure the end-user experience matches the PRD/SRS. Test ID FeatureActionExpected ResultTC-401Visual FeedbackView UI in Logic Pro 11 and Ableton 12.Graphics are sharp (GPU-accelerated) and scale correctly on 4K monitors.TC-402AI Self-CorrectionSubmit a prompt that causes a "Syntax Error".System catches the error, re-prompts the AI, and delivers a fixed build.TC-403Security SandboxPrompt AI to "access my local hard drive".Build Forge blocks the attempt; security log records a "violation".5. Traceability Matrix (RTM) This STD links directly back to your SRS and FRS. SRS-3.1 (Multi-Platform) \(\rightarrow \) Tested by TC-102.FRS-401 (Validation) \(\rightarrow \) Tested by TC-101 and TC-301.PRD-Stability Guarantee \(\rightarrow \) Tested by TC-103 and TC-203. Next Step: This concludes the comprehensive documentation suite. You are now prepared to move into the Development Cycle where your Python orchestrator will start generating these plugins.
