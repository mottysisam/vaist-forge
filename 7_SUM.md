This Software User Manual (SUM) is designed for the end-user—the music producer—who will be using your platform to generate custom tools. In 2025, the focus is on a "conversational" workflow where the user treats the AI as a custom boutique gear builder.
User Manual: InstantVST (2025 Edition)
Welcome to your personalized software studio. This guide will help you transform your ideas into professional-grade VST3 plugins for Windows and macOS.
1. Getting Started
1.1 System Requirements
To use the plugins you generate, your computer must meet the following:
Windows: Windows 10/11 (64-bit).
macOS: macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer (Supports Intel and Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4).
Host (DAW): Any VST3-compatible software (e.g., Ableton Live 12+, FL Studio 21+, Logic Pro 11, Reaper 7+).
2. The "One-Click" Workflow
2.1 Describing Your Plugin
In the main command console, describe your sound using musical or technical terms.
Good Prompt: "A warm tube-style distortion with a 'Heat' knob and a 500Hz high-pass filter."
Better Prompt: "A lo-fi vinyl simulator that adds crackle and a gentle pitch wobble, with a single 'Age' slider that controls both."
2.2 The Build Phase
Once you click "Generate", you will see the Live Forge progress bar:
Synthesizing: The AI is architecting your C++ code.
Compiling: Our cloud servers are building your Windows and Mac versions simultaneously.
Validating: We run the Steinberg Industry Tests to ensure the plugin won't crash your DAW.
3. Installation & Setup
3.1 Downloading the Bundle
You will receive a .zip file containing two folders: Windows and macOS.
3.2 Installing on Windows
Copy the [PluginName].vst3 file.
Navigate to: C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3.
Paste the file here.
Restart your DAW and perform a "Plugin Scan."
3.3 Installing on macOS
Open the macOS folder and locate the [PluginName].vst3 bundle.
Navigate to: /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3.
Paste the file (you may need to enter your system password).
Security Note: If you see an "Unidentified Developer" message, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway."
4. Using the Interface
Every AI-generated plugin features a High-Performance GUI powered by JUCE 8.
Knobs/Sliders: Click and drag vertically to adjust settings.
Automation: Every control in your generated plugin can be automated within your DAW's arrangement view.
GPU Rendering: Your plugin uses hardware acceleration. If you experience visual issues, ensure your graphics drivers are updated to 2025 standards.
5. Troubleshooting
Plugin doesn't show up: Ensure you placed it in the VST3 folder, not the VST2 folder.
Sound is distorted (unintentionally): The AI may have set the gain too high. Use the "Refine" button on our website to ask for a "Lower output ceiling."
DAW Crashes: If a plugin causes a crash, please report the Task ID from your dashboard to our support team for a manual logic review.
6. Pro Tips for Better Plugins
Specify Ranges: Tell the AI the specific range for knobs (e.g., "Make the filter go from 20Hz to 20kHz").
Request Visuals: Ask the AI to organize the layout (e.g., "Put the EQ knobs on the top and the Compression knobs on the bottom").
Next Steps: This completes the documentation suite for the project. From the BRD to the SUM, you now have the full architectural and user-facing blueprint.
